## Data Science Career Paths in Industry for Physicists <a name="webinar"></a>

#### November 16, 2022, 12:00 pm

One of the most exciting career paths for physicists today is data science. Skills acquired in physics training are highly relevant for the daily tasks of a data scientist. In the next DSECOP webinar, our [panelists](#22-september-panelists) will discuss their experience as data scientists in private industry and how their physics education prepared them for their careers. The discussion will also highlight skills and knowledge undergraduate physics majors need for data science careers.

The webinar will take place on Wednesday, Sep 14th, at 12:00 pm. The panelists are [Jamie Antonelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamie-antonelli) from Blue Cross Blue Shield, [Tony Chu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toekneechew/) from ECS, [Nima Dehmamy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nima-dehmamy-57770a4a/) from IBM Research, and [Jennifer Hobbs](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zeWhseAAAAAJ) from Intelinair.

  <p>Dr. Amy Roberts is an Assistant Professor in the Physics department, where she searches for “dark matter” with specialized detectors.  Although gravitational measurements suggest this “dark matter” makes up fully 80% of the universe’s mass, it has never been directly detected.  Dr. Roberts is a member of the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search collaboration (SuperCDMS), which specializes in sensing the faintest possible signals from highly-sensitive phonon detectors.  Her work focuses on understanding the detector response at low energies, novel signal analysis, and the data acquisition and software tools needed to keep specialized detectors running optimally.</p>
