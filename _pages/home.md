Prepare your physics students for diverse career paths by equipping them with essential skills beyond traditional subject material.

The Effective Practices for Physics Programs (EP3) guide and the Phys21 report from the Joint Taskforce on Undergraduate Physics Programs (J-TUPP) emphasize the need for broader education. With the explosive growth of data science within physics, formal instruction in this field is just beginning to be included in curricula. As a result, students often have to learn data science on their own, either at the graduate level or through capstone projects.

At the Data Science Community of Practice (DSECOP), we recognize the urgency of enhancing data science education in physics and believe that leveraging investments in computation can significantly accelerate progress. The 2016 AAPT Recommendations for Computational Physics in the Undergraduate Physics Curriculum report and the Partnership for Integration of Computation in Undergraduate Physics (PICUP) have already paved the way for integrating computation into physics courses. Now it's time to extend this integration to data science.

While computation is becoming normalized in undergraduate physics education, data science education is lagging behind. The 2016 AAPT report acknowledged the significance of data science skills and encouraged educators to stay updated with the latest developments in this field. Fortunately, with the availability of new tools, developing data science skills has become more accessible than ever before.

DSECOP, a program funded by the APS Innovation Fund and led by the APS Group on Data Science (GDS), aims to support physics educators in integrating data science into their courses. We offer a range of resources and opportunities to help you stay ahead:

DSECOP is a collaborative effort involving institutions such as UMD, NIST, and many others. By joining our community, you'll connect with like-minded educators, share ideas, and contribute to the advancement of data science education in physics.

## Modules
DSECOP [fellows](team/#2023-fellows) prepare comprehensive data science [modules](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP) specifically designed for undergraduate physics classes. These [modules](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP) cover fundamental concepts and techniques in data science, emphasizing their applications in physics. From data acquisition and cleaning to exploratory data analysis and machine learning, the modules provide hands-on experiences and real-world examples. By integrating these modules into their courses, educators empower students with practical data science skills for data-driven scientific research and beyond.

## Events
Join our [webinars](webinars) and [workshops](workshops) where experts share their insights and best practices for incorporating data science into physics education.

<!-- There is a critical need to teach physicists skills beyond the subject material so students are prepared for multiple career paths. Projects, such as the Effective Practices for Physics Programs (EP3) guide and the Phys21 report from the Joint Taskforce on Undergraduate Physics Programs (J-TUPP), indicate this. These efforts coincide with an explosive growth of data science within physics. Data science is rapidly emerging as an excellent career option. However, formal instruction is only starting to be included in physics curricula . Students mostly learn this material on their ownâ€”often at the graduate level, or occasionally through capstone projects.

We see an opportunity to quickly boost data science education by leveraging investments in computation, which is becoming normalized in the physics curriculum. The 2016 AAPT Recommendations for Computational Physics in the Undergraduate Physics Curriculum report and the Partnership for Integration of Computation in Undergraduate Physics (PICUP) further galvanized physics educators in seeing the importance of and working towards integrating computation in typical physics courses, rather than a stand alone course.

Although computation is becoming normalized in undergraduate physics education, data science education is not similarly included. The 2016 AAPT report preceded the rapid emergence of resources to teach data science. However, the report acknowledged the importance of this area and advocated that educators pay attention to the developments that may allow for them to teach such skills. In the time since the report, developing data science skills is more accessible through newly available tools.

The Data Science Education Community of Practice (DSECOP), a program funded by the APS Innovation Fund and led by the APS Group on Data Science (GDS), seeks to support physics educators in integrating data science in their courses in multiple ways:
