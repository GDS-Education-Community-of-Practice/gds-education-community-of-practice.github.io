## Announcement

#### Goal
This year, we aim to build on the success of our [first workshop](#dsecop-june-2022-workshop). Our primary focus is to continue developing a vibrant community of educators committed to incorporating data science into the undergraduate physics curriculum.

To achieve this goal, we plan to have thought-provoking lectures and presentations from faculty members who are already engaged in this process. We will also be showcasing the latest contributions from fellows in our program who are developing innovative modules for inclusion in the existing curriculum. Additionally, we are excited to welcome participation from industry professionals who can bring their unique perspectives. 

#### Topics 
We anticipate this to be a highly interactive workshop, with plenty of time for discussion and contributed talks from all participants. Here is the [schedule of the workshop](./../assets/23_Workshop/DSECOP23_Schedule.pdf). Some of the topics we plan to cover in this workshop include:
- Strategies for integrating data science concepts into the undergraduate physics curriculum
- Best practices for teaching data science to students with varying levels of experience
- Exploring the latest tools and technologies for data analysis in the physics classroom
- Sharing successful case studies of data-driven physics instruction

#### Apply
We encourage all physics faculty teaching undergraduate physics to apply for this workshop. We also welcome graduate students, postdocs, industry professionals, and data science enthusiasts to apply. As with our first workshop, we expect in-person attendance as this event is highly interactive.

Because this workshop has limited space, we have an application process. Please fill in the  [application form](https://forms.gle/iFLo7y8HXBmTdoxe8) to be considered. All participants have a non-refundable $75 registration fee. Applications received by **April 14th at 5 PM ET** will receive full consideration for contributed talks and financial support. We will notify you by April 21st when we make our decision.

## Announcement

We are delighted to announce the first workshop by the Data Science Education Community of Practice (DSECOP) to be held on June 22–24, 2022, at the Institute for Physical Science and Technology in College Park, MD.

The primary goal of this workshop is to develop a community of practice around incorporating data science into the undergraduate physics curriculum.  This workshop will include lectures from faculty who are already engaged in this process and presentations from fellows in our program developing modules for inclusion in the existing curriculum.  We also expect participation from the industry. There will be plenty of time for discussion and contributed talks.

Please fill in the [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfj30--o6JGJbGeq2uUPBI9fIu0SoPLs0OXTRpi-OmHmkFAtg/viewform) to be considered for this workshop. Because of the interactive nature of this workshop, we expect in-person attendance.

Primary lodging will be at the dorms at the University of Maryland, conveniently located to the lectures.  Lodging and meals will be $390 for the workshop.
