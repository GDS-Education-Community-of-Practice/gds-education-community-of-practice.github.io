## DSECOP June 2022 Workshop

We are delighted to announce the first workshop by the Data Science Education Community of Practice (DSECOP) to be held on June 22â€“24, 2022, at the Institute for Physical Science and Technology in College Park, MD.

The primary goal of this workshop is to develop a community of practice around incorporating data science into the undergraduate physics curriculum.  This workshop will include lectures from faculty who are already engaged in this process and presentations from fellows in our program developing modules for inclusion in the existing curriculum.  We also expect participation from the industry. There will be plenty of time for discussion and contributed talks.

Primary lodging will be at the dorms at the University of Maryland, conveniently located to the lectures.  Lodging and meals will be $390 for the workshop.
