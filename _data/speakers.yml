- name: Boris Kozinsky
  bio: Boris Kozinsky is the Thomas D. Cabot Associate Professor of Computational Materials Science at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He studied at MIT for his B.S. degrees in Physics, Mathematics, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and received his PhD degree in Physics also from MIT. He then established and led the atomistic computational materials design team at Bosch Research in Cambridge MA. In 2018 he started the Materials Intelligence Research group at Harvard that works at the intersection of fundamental materials physics, computational chemistry, and data science. His group develops and uses atomistic and electronic structure computations and machine learning for understanding and predicting quantum-level microscopic effects, particularly ionic, electronic and thermal transport and transformations in materials for energy storage and conversion. His work on the development and application of computational methods led to computation-driven design of  materials in a wide range of materials systems, including 1D and 2D materials, piezoelectrics, thermoelectrics, batteries, superionic conductors, catalysts, and functional polymers.

- name: Aaron Gilad Kusne
  bio: A. Gilad Kusne received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Carnegie Mellon University. He is a Staff Scientist with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, Maryland, and an adjunct professor with the University of Maryland. His research is part of the White House’s Materials Genome Initiative at NIST, a project which aims to accelerate the discovery and optimization of advanced materials. He leads the machine learning team of an international, cross-disciplinary effort building autonomous research systems, with the goal of advancing solid state, soft, and biological materials. For these systems, machine learning performs experiment design, execution (in the lab and in silico), and analysis. For his work, he has been awarded the NIST Bronze Award (highest NIST award). He is also the lead founder and organizer of the annual Machine Learning for Materials Research Bootcamp and Workshop—educating next generation and mid-career material scientists in machine learning.
