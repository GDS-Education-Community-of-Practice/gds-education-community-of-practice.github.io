- name: Federica Bianco
  bio: Dr. Federica Bianco is an Assistant Professor at the University of Delaware in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and in the School of Public Policy and Administration and a Resident Faculty in the Data Science Institute. She works on data-driven solutions to problems that span from the nature of explosions in the sky to delays in the justice system. She studies lightcurves, time series of light, in astronomy to understand stellar evolution,  in the urban environment at the Urban Observatory, where the study of urban lightcurves enables sociological, ecologic, economic inference, and in many other interdisciplinary adventures. Her pedagogy is focused on teaching Data Science across domains and to people from all backgrounds.

- name: Aaron Gilad Kusne
  bio: A. Gilad Kusne received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Carnegie Mellon University. He is a Staff Scientist with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, Maryland, and an adjunct professor with the University of Maryland. His research is part of the White House’s Materials Genome Initiative at NIST, a project which aims to accelerate the discovery and optimization of advanced materials. He leads the machine learning team of an international, cross-disciplinary effort building autonomous research systems, with the goal of advancing solid state, soft, and biological materials. For these systems, machine learning performs experiment design, execution (in the lab and in silico), and analysis. For his work, he has been awarded the NIST Bronze Award (highest NIST award). He is also the lead founder and organizer of the annual Machine Learning for Materials Research Bootcamp and Workshop—educating next generation and mid-career material scientists in machine learning.

- name: Boris Kozinsky
  bio: Boris Kozinsky is the Thomas D. Cabot Associate Professor of Computational Materials Science at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He studied at MIT for his B.S. degrees in Physics, Mathematics, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and received his PhD degree in Physics also from MIT. He then established and led the atomistic computational materials design team at Bosch Research in Cambridge MA. In 2018 he started the Materials Intelligence Research group at Harvard that works at the intersection of fundamental materials physics, computational chemistry, and data science. His group develops and uses atomistic and electronic structure computations and machine learning for understanding and predicting quantum-level microscopic effects, particularly ionic, electronic and thermal transport and transformations in materials for energy storage and conversion. His work on the development and application of computational methods led to computation-driven design of  materials in a wide range of materials systems, including 1D and 2D materials, piezoelectrics, thermoelectrics, batteries, superionic conductors, catalysts, and functional polymers.

- name: Trevor David Rhone
  bio: Trevor David Rhone received a liberal arts education from Macalester College. He received his PhD from Columbia University where he studied of two-dimensional electron systems using light scattering. Rhone spent several years at NTT Basic research laboratories in Japan where he received the BRL director award. While working at the National Institute of Materials Science in Tsukuba, Japan, he transitioned to materials informatics – an emerging field of research combining materials science and machine learning. He continued this work at Harvard University as a postdoctoral prize fellow where he used machine learning to search for new two-dimensional magnetic materials. <br> Rhone is presently an assistant professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. His research interests are at the intersection of materials science and artificial intelligence. His research aims to understand emergent phenomena in electron systems, with an emphasis on spin degrees of freedom in two-dimensional materials. He recently received the NSF CAREER award for research in materials intelligence.
